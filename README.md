# Coding Bootcamp Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This webpage is used as a study guide that contains notes and information from the bootcamp's prework modules. I built this project as a way for me to promote note taking and have something to readily compare/add upon throughout the course of the bootcamp. The website itself definitely helps me be more prepared for the bootcamp and has taught me many useful shortcuts, commands, and functions from HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git.
